            <h1>Python Projects</h1>
            <p>My first exposure to Python was in 2022. This was after I had gone back to school and was the first language that they taught me there. I have to say that I am a big fan of Python. I know that there is still a lot to learn about Python, but I have had a lot of fun running into problems and then staring at the screen trying to figure out why my code wasn't working. It has been a humbling experience and I know that if I had started off with a different language I might have had a few more tears along the path. I have a couple of examples of some of the projects that I have worked on with Python.</p>
