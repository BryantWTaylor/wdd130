        Content
        </h2>
        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>
        My homepage will be about me and why I decided to get into tech and specifically software development. I will talk about how my family is one of my biggest motivators and how I want to be able to provide a good life for them and to be able to thrive and give them wonderful experiences. I will have pictures of myself and my family. On this first page I will also have a highlight of my web development projects and a highlight of my python projects. These will be images that when clicked on will take the visitor to the respective pages.

        <h3>Web Development Projects</h3>
        <p>
        This page will be dedicated to the projects that I have done with HTML and CSS. This will be my web development page. I plan to have this page grow as I continue to work on personal and school projects to hone my skills. As far as showing off the projects that I have done, I think that I want to have a screenshot of the homepage and when clicked, it will take the visitor to the actual site.

        <h3>Python Projects</h3>
        <p>
        This page will be dedicated to the projects that I have done with Python. I will showcase some of my favorite projects that I have worked on and I also anticipate that this will grow as I continue to develop and work on projects. As for viewing these projects. I think I will also take screenshots, but I will take screenshots of my code and have a link under them that will take the visitor to the specific project on github. I have yet to push any of my python projects to github, but I will do that for this project.

        <h2>
        Wireframes
        </h2>
        <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

        <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>         
        There will be two paragraphs of text. One will talk about my background in regards to when I was introduced to coding, the other will talk about how my family is my inspiration for pursing Software Development. Beneath the two paragraphs and the family images, there will an image relating to my projects, one that is Web Dev and one that is Python. Below those there will be a link that will take them to the respective projects page.
        </p>
        <img src="images/wireframe-homepage.jpg" alt="home page wireframe">

        <h3>Web Development Projects</h3>
        <p>         
        The 4 main image blocks will be screenshots of the homepage of my Web Dev projects. The button below will take them to the external site.
        </p>
        <img src="images/wireframe-webdev-2.jpg" alt="page 2 wireframe">

        <h3>Python Projects</h3>
        <p>         
        I will feature my two main python projects on this page. The images will be a screenshot of either the code, or the program running in the terminal. I haven't decided fully on that yet. I'll probably have to look at both and see what looks better. Either way the button under the image will link to my github which will allow the visitor to see my code.
