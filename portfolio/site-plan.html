        I'm Bryant Taylor and I am an aspiring Software Developer. I was first introduced to coding back in highschool when I took a Computer Programming class where we were taught how to use Microsoft Visual Basic. That was many years ago and I let other things distract me from pursuing Software Development. My desire was reignited in 2021 when my wife started a program called TechMoms that taught her the basics of Web Development and I started to find resources to learn HTML and CSS online. In 2022 I went back to school while working full time to learn Software Development in a more traditional manner. I have now been exposed to HTML, CSS, Python, and some JavaScript. I am looking forward to learning even more.
        </p>
        <p>
        I wanted to get into Software development for my family. While talking to my connections that work in the Software Development community I have learned that it is a unique field that can offer a lot of options to help me provide the life that I want for my family that I so far havenâ€™t been able to do in my current field. I have a beautiful wife and two wonderful children that mean everything to me. I want them to have all the opportunities to succeed in life and I feel that will be best accomplished by my working in the Software Development field.

        <h3>Web Development Projects</h3>
        <p>
        My first exposure to HTML was in 2021. My wife told me about freecodecamp.org and I so I jumped on and started to go through the resources that they had. I learned a lot, while also realizing that there is a lot to know about Web Development and that you have to have somewhat of an eye for design. That design muscle is still one that I am developing, but with time and practice I might be able to get there. Below are some of my Web Development projects that I have worked on.

        <h3>Python Projects</h3>
        <p>
        My first exposure to Python was in 2022. This was after I had gone back to school and was the first language that they taught me there. I have to say that I am a big fan of Python. I know that there is still a lot to learn about Python, but I have had a lot of fun running into problems and then staring at the screen trying to figure out why my code wasn't working. It has been a humbling experience and I know that if I had started off with a different language I might have had a few more tears along the path. I have a couple of examples of some of the projects that I have worked on with Python.

        <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

        <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>         
        There will be two paragraphs of text. One will talk about my background in regards to when I was introduced to coding, the other will talk about how my family is my inspiration for pursing Software Development. Beneath the two paragraphs and the family images, there will an image relating to my projects, one that is Web Dev and one that is Python. Below those there will be a link that will take them to the respective projects page.
        </p>

        <h3>Web Development Projects</h3>
        <p>         
        The 4 main image blocks will be screenshots of the homepage of my Web Dev projects. The button below will take them to the external site.

        <h3>Python Projects</h3>
        <p>         
        I will feature my two main python projects on this page. The images will be a screenshot of either the code, or the program running in the terminal. I haven't decided fully on that yet. I'll probably have to look at both and see what looks better. Either way the button under the image will link to my github which will allow the visitor to see my code.
