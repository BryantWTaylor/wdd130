                <h1>My Story</h1>
                <p>I'm Bryant Taylor and I am an aspiring Software Developer. I was first introduced to coding back in highschool when I took a Computer Programming class where we were taught how to use Microsoft Visual Basic. That was many years ago and I let other things distract me from pursuing Software Development. My desire was reignited in 2021 when my wife started a program called TechMoms that taught her the basics of Web Development and I started to find resources to learn HTML and CSS online. In 2022 I went back to school while working full time to learn Software Development in a more traditional manner. I have now been exposed to HTML, CSS, Python, and some JavaScript. I am looking forward to learning even more.</p>

                <h2>My Reason</h2>
                <p>I wanted to get into Software development for my family. While talking to my connections that work in the Software Development community I have learned that it is a unique field that can offer a lot of options to help me provide the life that I want for my family that I so far haven't been able to do in my current field. I have a beautiful wife and two wonderful children that mean everything to me. I want them to have all the opportunities to succeed in life and I feel that will be best accomplished by my working in the Software Development field.</p>
